## My first test file in R


## Notes 
## when you source on save in R studio it seems to execute the script
## source('~/Code/R/Sandpit/DataTypes.R')

x <- 1:20
x # this does not seem to work when run in a script?
print(x)
print(y)

x <- c(0.5,4,59)    ## Numeric
print(x)

y <- c("a:z")     ## Character
print(y)
